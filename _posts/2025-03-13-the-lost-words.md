Introduction / motivation of why this project is relevant and interesting
(good intro)
Are book bans being targeted against a certain community? This is a question I have been trying to grapple with recently. In a time of extreme political divide, we find ourselves in fights related to war and 

We all have the right to learn. 
We hear about banning media left and right and how that is skewing people's perception of the world. Everyone holds their own beliefs about this subject. However, a close confidant of mine once told me that we should challenge our beliefs. That is what I'm here to do. Challenge what I believe in to see where that leads me.

You will write a blog post that summarizes your and highlights your dataset.  Imagine that you are writing to a "Stat 386 student audience" and your goal is (1) to showcase your work, (2) to provide enough detail for someone who would like to do a similar project to get started, and (3) to highlight and summarize your data.  Your blog post should contain the following (also see the rubric below for more details):
Motivating question (what are you hoping to learn from this data?)

(ethicality of data collection)
## Meet the Data
Information about how you determined that it was ethical / allowable to get the data that you gathered and/or how you implemented good scraping practice
In this blog, I used the following resources:
* Google books API
* PEN America's Index of School Book Bans (July 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023)
Truthfully talk about how my API got all used up THRICE

(teaching my steps)
Summary of the steps needed to get your data with an emphasis on teaching other how they could get started with a similar project
    Overly detailed accounts are not required (and discouraged)
    Just provide enough info to help someone else potentially get started with a similar project

(EDA highlights)
EDA highlights: summary statistics, summary graphics, and/or information about final dataset (e.g., total sample size, counts of categorical variables, numerical summaries of numeric variables)
    What are the most interesting findings of your EDA?

What I lacked in skill I made up with my passion.

Are you ready for the results?

One look at <a href="https://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10" target="_blank">Top 10 Most Challenged Books of 2023</a> by the American Library Association (ALA) and you will find that most of the challenged books to be LGBTQ+ related. The term "challenged" is defined in by the ALA as "an attempt to remove or restrict materials, based upon the objections of a person or group."

## After thoughts
Why do book bans matter? Firstly, the first ammendment right of freedom to speech is affected by this. Secondly, a vast majority of the book industry is white peeple-- traditionally white males. This leaves underrepresented groups such as those belonging to the LGBT+ community to be voicless and their stories at risk of being lost. Books about them and their lives are important to create bridges between communities to create harmony! With lost words come lost worlds.
