<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>re book bans being targeted against a certain community? This is a question I have been trying to grapple with. We hear about banning media left and right and how that is skewing people's perception of the world. Everyone holds their own beliefs about this subject. However, a close confidant of mine once told me that we should challenge our beliefs. That is what I'm here to do. Challenge what I believe in to see where that leads me. </p>

# please give me till tuesday march 18 to finish this T^T. my 12 hours of code came back inconclusive. AND i spent the whole weekend on this code to no avail.

In this blog, I used the following resources:
* Google books API
* PEN America's Index of School Book Bans (July 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023)
* ALA's Top 100 Most Challenged Books of 1990-1999
* ALA's Top 100 Most Challenged Books of 2000-2009
* ALA's Top 100 Most Challenged Books of 2010-2019


What I lacked in skill I made up with my passion.

Are you ready for the results?

One look at [Top 10 Most Challenged Books of 2023](https://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10) by the American Library Association (ALA) and you will find that most of the challenged books to be LGBTQ+ related. The term "challenged" is defined in by the ALA as "an attempt to remove or restrict materials, based upon the objections of a person or group."


## After thoughts
Why does this matter? A vast majority of the book industry is white peeple-- traditionally white males. This leaves underrepresented groups such as those belonging to the LGBT+ community to be voicless and their stories at risk of being lost. Books about them and their lives are important to create bridges between communities to create harmony! With lost words come lost worlds.
