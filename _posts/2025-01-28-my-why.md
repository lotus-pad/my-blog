# Welcome to My First Blog Post!

Woo-hoo. You made it! Let's start this journey together, shall we? Let's start stepping on Lotus pads!

### Why I Started Blogging
I hope I have good reasons in the future but right now I have some simple reasons:
- I wanna learn how to write better
- Learn more about what *I* can learn when I blog

> If you take care of your appliances, it will take care of you.

### code example
```python
print("Hello, World! Welcome to Lotus Pad")
```
